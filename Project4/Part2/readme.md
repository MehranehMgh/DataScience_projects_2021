In this section we were asked to perform methods listed below for predicting discrete variables (a.k.a. classification).
- Logistic Regression Classifier
- Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classifier
- K-nearest neighbor (KNN) Classifier
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier
- Naive Bayes
