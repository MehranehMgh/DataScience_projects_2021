# DataScience_projects_2021

In this assignment we were asked to perform clustering on the Spotify Dataset and develop a recommendation system for the users.
The dataset consisted of songs and their features like danceability, energy, etc. 
We were asked to perform clustering on the dataset and then recommend songs to the users based on the clusters.
The method of how to recommend from those clusters was on our own!
